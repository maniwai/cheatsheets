### What is Python

Python is dynamic, strongly typed, object-oriented, functional, memory-managed

##### Dynamic

- You don't specify the type of a variable when you declare it
- Instead, the type of a variable is inferred from the value assigned to it at runtime

##### Strongly typed

- You can only execute operations that are supported by the target type

##### object-oriented

- Everything is an object, and variables are simply references to objects
  > It even supports features such as multiple inheritance, operator overloading, ...

##### Functional programming

- Functions are first-class objects that can be created, manipulated, and passed around just like any other object
