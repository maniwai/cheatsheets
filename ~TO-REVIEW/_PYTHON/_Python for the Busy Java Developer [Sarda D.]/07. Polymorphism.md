# Polymorphism

```py
class Square(object):
    def draw(self, canvas):
        # ...
```

```py
class Circle(object):
    def draw(self, canvas):
        # ...
```

Since Python is dynamic, the following code works just fine without an explicit Shape class

```py
shapes = [Square(), Circle()]
for shape in shapes:
    shape.draw(canvas)
```

- There is no real advantage to having a common Shape base class that defines `draw(canvas)` since there’s no static type check to enforce that anyway
- If the objects in the shapes list did not implement draw(canvas), you’ll find that out at runtime
  > In short, **use inheritance for shared behavior**, not for polymorphism.
