# List

### Slice Syntax

The **slice syntax** allow to extract element within a range

We can extract element within a range with the **slice syntax**: `[start:stop:step]`

```python
numbers = [0, 1, 2, 'three', 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(numbers[4:]) # [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(numbers[2:-2]) # [2, 'three', 4, 5, 6, 7]
print(numbers[::2]) # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
print(numbers[::-1]) # [9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 'three', 2, 1, 0]
```

The copy returned by the slice notation is a **shallow copy**

```py
copy = numbers[:]
print(copy == numbers) # True
print(copy is numbers) # False
print(id(copy), id(numbers)) # 1880257646976 1880257648896
```

> `id()` is similar to `hashCode()` in Java

### how to iterate lists

```py
numbers = [10, 20, 30]
for number in numbers:
    print(number) # -> 10 20 30
for index, number in enumerate(numbers):
    print(index) # -> 0 1 2
for index in range(len(numbers)):
    print(index) # -> 0 1 2
```

### how to mutate lists

```py
toys = ['bat', 'ball', 'truck']
if 'bat' in toys:
    print('found!')
toys.append('doll')
print(toys) # -> ['bat', 'ball', 'truck', 'doll']
toys.remove('ball')
print(toys) # -> ['bat', 'truck', 'doll']
toys.sort()
print(toys) # -> ['bat', 'doll', 'truck']
```

### Stacks and queues with lists

```py
stack = []
stack.append("event") # Push
event = stack.pop() # Pop

queue = []
queue.append("event") # Push
event = queue.pop(0) # Pop from beginning
```

> List provides many more opÃ©rations, such as `extend`, `insert`, and `reverse`

### List comprehensions

- Provide a compact and readable syntax for generating lists in a single line of code.
- Syntax: `[fn(x) for x in iter]`

```py
squared_numbers = [i ** 2 for i in range(5)] # from 0 to 4
print(squared_numbers)  #-> [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]

squared_odd_numbers = [num ** 2 for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0]
print(squared_odd_numbers)  # Output: [1, 9, 25, 49, 81]
```
