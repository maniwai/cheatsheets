### Timers

##### The `clearInterval` Method

`clearInterval(id)` takes the id of the interval we want to stop

```javascript
const id = setInterval(() => {
  // ... logic
  clearInterval(id);
}, 1000);
```

> `setInterval` returns an id we need to provide to `clearInterval`

> Note: we can access id inside the id inside the closure, we don't need to pass it thru an argument

### Debouncing Technique

**Debouncing** is a technique to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often

```javascript
let timeout;
searchInput.addEventListener("input", () => {
  clearTimeout(timeout); // we first clear the previous timeout
  timeout = setTimeout(() => {
    queryAPI(); //
  }, 1000);
});
```

> `queryAPI()` will be executed after a delay only if the function is not called in meantime

### Throttling Technique

**Throttling** is a technique to limits the rate at which a function can be executed.

```javascript
let isThrottled = false;
window.addEventListener("scroll", () => {
  if (!isThrottled) {
    console.log("scrolling");
    isThrottled = true;
    setTimeout(() => {
      isThrottled = false;
    }, 2000);
  }
});
```

> `isThrottled` will be set back to `false` after a delay to be able to run the if block again
