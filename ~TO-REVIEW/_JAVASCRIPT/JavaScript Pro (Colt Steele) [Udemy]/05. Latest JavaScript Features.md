### Optional Chaining

`?.` is a syntaxic sugar to return the value if the nested parent object exist

```javascript
const firstName1 = user?.name?.first;
// instead of
const firstName2 = user && user.name && user.name.first;
```

### Nullish Coalescing

`??` is a logical operator that returns its right-hand operand if its left-hand operand is **null or undefined**

```javascript
null ?? "fallback!"; // 'fallback!'
```

> It's the opposite of the `&&` (logical and) which returns the right-hand if the left-hand is true

The `||` (logical or) is similar but it returns the right-hand if the left-hand is evaluate to false

```javascript
0 || "falback"; // 'falback'
0 ?? "falback"; // 0
```

> _0 is evaluate false in JS_

### Numeric Separators

**Numeric Separators** are used for readability

```javascript
let num = 1_123_456_789;
```

### `Array.at()` Method

It's used to provide a negative number to access an array from the end.
Otherwise we can use standard `myArr[i]`

```javascript
const colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow"];
colors.at(-1); // 'yellow'
```

> with `at()` we can pass negative numbers to iterate from the end, which was not possible with `color[-1] `(_does not work_)

### `String.replaceAll()` Method

```javascript
myString.replaceAll("old", "new");
```

> The `replace()` method replace only the first occurence, so we had to pass a Regex to replace all occurences

### Logical Assignment

**Logical Assignments** are a combination of **logical operators** (`&&`, `||`, `??`) **and assignment expressions**

- **Logical OR Assignment** will assign the value is **falsy**

  ```javascript
  let firstName = false;
  firstName ||= "Ringo"; // 'Ringo'
  ```

  > Before we would write: `firstName || (firstName = "Ringo")`

- **Logical AND Assignment** will assign a value is **trusly**

  ```javascript
  let firstName = "Ringo";
  firstName &&= console.log(firstName); // 'Ringo'
  ```

- **Nullish Coalescing Assignment** will assign the value if it's **null** or **undefined**
  ```javascript
  let firstName = null;
  firstName ??= "Ringo"; // 'Ringo'
  ```
