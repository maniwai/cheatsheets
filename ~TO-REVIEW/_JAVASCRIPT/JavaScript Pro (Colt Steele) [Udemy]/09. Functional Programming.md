### FP Paradigm

- composing with pure functions
- avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-efects
- FP is often declarative rather than imperative
- application state flows through pure functions
- methods used: `map`, `filter`, `some`/`every`. `find`/`findIndex`, `reduce`
- concepts: higher order functions / first class functions, pure functions, immutability, closure, partial application / currying, function composition
- FP tries to avoid: looping, mutation and shared state, variable declaration
