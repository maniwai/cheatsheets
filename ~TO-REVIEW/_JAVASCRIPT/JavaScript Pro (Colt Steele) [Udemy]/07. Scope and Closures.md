### The `var` Keyword

The `var` keyword is always defined in the global scope

```javascript
if (true) {
  var animal = "Bird";
}
window.animal; // 'Bird'
```

> Note: `var` can override global properties

### Hoisting

The var keyword is hoisting

Hoisting refer to JS pulling the `var` variable on the top of the excution and set it to undefined

```javascript
console.log(food); // undefined
var food = "pizza";
```

> with `let` and `const`, even JS is still hoisting the variable behind the scene, it won't be accessible before its declare in any way

### IIFE (Imediatly Invoked Function Expression)

IIFE is a function expression that is defined and executed immediately after its creation

- It sas used to resolve `var` global scope issues to avoid the **_global scope pollution_**
- Its not often used now with `let` and `const` which are **_block-scoped variables_**

```javascript
(function () {
  console.log("From IIFE");
})(); // From IIFE
```

##### Singleton Pattern

IIFE with Closure can be used for a Singleton:

```javascript
const counter = (function () {
  let count = 0;
  return function () {
    return count++;
  };
})();
counter(); // 0
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2
```

### Closures

- Closure is simply the ability of a inner function to access variables defined in the outer function

- The closure **maintain an internal state** without exposing that state to the outside world.
- By returning a closure we can protect the properties of the outer scope been inaccessible

```javascript
function idGenerator() {
  let count = 1;
  return function generate() {
    return count++;
  };
}
const nextID = idGenerator();
nextID(); // 1
nextID(); // 2
nextID(); // 3
```

> Note: The closure keep incrementing because it **keep an internal state** of the outer variable `count`

##### Returning An Object

Closure also applies to inner objects

```javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return {
    increment: function () {
      return count++;
    },
  };
}
const counter = createCounter();
counter; // {increment: Æ’}
```

> The key point is the object is hidden, we have not access to it to manipulate directly
