### Functional Programming

FP treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

- Composing wtih _pure functions_
- avoiding _shared state_
- avoiding _mutable data_
- avoiding _side-effects_

### Imperative vs Declarative Paradigms

- Imperative Programming: Proceducal & OOP
- Declarative Programming: Functional & Reactive Programming

##### Imperative Programming: OOP

- Focuses on "How" to solve
- States the order in which operations occur

```javascript
for (var i = 0; i < courses.length; i++) {
  courses[i].lastModified = new Date();
}
```

##### Declarative Programming: FP

- Focuses on "What" to solve
- Does not state the order in which to execute operations

```javascript
courses.map((course) => {
  course.lastModified = new Date();
  return course;
});
```
