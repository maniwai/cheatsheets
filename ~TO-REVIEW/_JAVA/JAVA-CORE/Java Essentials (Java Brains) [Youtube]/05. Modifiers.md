# Encapsulation
**Access Modifiers** allow to ***encapsulate*** and restrict access to member variables and methods
- `public`: Accessible to everyone
- `private`: Not accessible outside the class
- `protected`: Accessible to subclasses
- **Default** access modifier (without a keyword): Accessible to the same  package (also called *package private*)

## Recommended Good Practice
- All ***state*** is `private`
- ***Methods*** an be mixed
- Use ***getters*** and ***setters*** to access internal ***state***
- ***Package-private*** rarely used
- `protected` based on inheritance access needs

# Static Modifier
static means we don't need an instance to access it, it directly belong to the class, not its instances.
- Inside a **static member,** we cannot access ***non-static members***, neither `this` keyword
- All instances of a class share the same `static` variable

# Final Modifier
The `final` keyword mark a variable as **constant**. ***We don't expect the value to change***
- It affect the variable or reference only:
	- Objects can be final, but doesn't affect its members
	- Collections can be final, but doesn't affect containing elements

> we can declare a variable as `final` without assigning a value. The value will be locked after the first assignment.

> final variables (constants) should be all uppercase separated with underscore: `final String COMPANY_NAME = "Acme Inc"`

## Avoid Magic Value
```java
final int MAX_ITEMS_IN_CART = 6;
if (numberOfItems > MAX_ITEMS_IN_CART) {
	// do something
}
```
> Use constants to document values instead of using them directly: `(numberOfItems > 6)`
