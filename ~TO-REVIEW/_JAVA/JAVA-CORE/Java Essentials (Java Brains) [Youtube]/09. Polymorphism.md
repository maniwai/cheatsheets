# Polymorphism
```java
SuperClass reference = new subclassInstance();
```
> We cannot access subclass specific methods with polymorphism. But **we can access subclass overriden mehtods**

## Polymorphism with Interfaces
```java
Drivable car = new SportCar();
car.drive();
```
> We can only access interfaces methods . If `Drivable` only defines the `drive()` method. We only can call `drive()`

# Casting
We can **downcast** a variable to access specific methods.
```java
Drivable car = new SportCar();
car.drive();
FuelVehicle vehicle = (FuelVehicle) car;
vehicle.refuel();
```
