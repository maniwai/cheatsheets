# Just In Time Compilation
Three ways to run Java bytecode:
- **Interpret** the intermediate byte code directly
- **Just In Time** Compilation: 
Just before executing, compile to native code
- **Ahead Of Time** Compilation (Experimental feature)
Convert intermediate code fully to native code before executing


Java Bytecode Execution Modes
- Interpretation:
	> Direct execution of intermediate bytecode.

- Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation:
	> Dynamic compilation to native code just before execution, optimizing performance.

- Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) Compilation (Experimental):
> Full conversion of intermediate code to native code pre-execution.
