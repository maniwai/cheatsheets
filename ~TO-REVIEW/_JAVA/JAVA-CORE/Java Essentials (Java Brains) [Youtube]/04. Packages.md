# Packages
- Used for grouping classes and interfaces 
- Can contain sub-packages
- Provides namespacing for class names
- Provides encapsulation - access control for code in classes 
```
package com.google;
class Car {}
```
Full path is: `com.google.Car`
## Default package
The default package refers to a class where we don't specify any package
> This is a bad practice, each class should specify a package name

# Importing Classes
We need to `import` any class in different package to use it.
- `import` is used to access a class from a different package
- We can use a ***fully qualified name*** instead of import: `com.google.Car`
- We can import all the classes of a package with `*`: `com.google.*`
```
import com.google.Car;
clas App {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Car car = new Car();
	}
}
```
