# Interfaces
- A class can implements **multiple** interfaces
- An interface can `extends` other interfaces
- interfaces can declare **constants** (final can be ommited)
- Interfaces can define `static` methods just like classes
- Interfeces can have `private` methods. Commonly used by the default methods
```
interface Drivable {
	int GLOBAL_VALUE = 42;
	public void drive();
}

interface FuelVehicle extends Drivable {
	public void refuel();
}

class SportCar implements FuelVehicle {
	@Override
	public void drive() {}

	@Override
	public void refuel() {}
}
```
> We can implement ***multiple interfaces***, its the main reason to use interfaces over abstract class is we 

## Interfaces vs Abstract Class
Both have different use cases:
- **Interfaces** define a contract
- **Abstract class** is a template (or starting point for classes)

# Default Methods
Interfaces can have a `default` method implementation
```
interface Drivable {
    public default void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving");
    }
}
```
> If we implement two interface with s***ame defaut method name***, we are ***force to implement*** the method or we have a compilation error
