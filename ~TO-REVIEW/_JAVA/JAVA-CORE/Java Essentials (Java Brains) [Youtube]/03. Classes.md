# Classes vs Objects
**Classes** are ***templates*** defining ***states*** and ***behaviors***
```java
class ClassName {
	type memberVariable; // also called "instance variable"
	type methodName (parameters) {
		// method body
	}
}
```
- **Classes** are ***blueprints*** and **Objects** are ***instances***
- **Classes** contain ***instance variables*** (or ***member variables***) and ***methods***
- A ***class definition*** forms a ***new type***. ***Object instances*** of the class are ***values of the type***
- You create a new ***instance*** using the ***new*** keyword
- The ***new*** keyword ***allocates memory*** for the object instance.
- The ***memory allocation*** happens ***at runtime*** (just when it's needed)
- ***Object variables*** are really ***reference variables*** (they point to an ***object instance***)
- ***References*** can be changed by having them point to other instances

# Constructor
`this()` is used to call a constructor inside another constructor
```java
Car() {
	mileage = 0;
}
Car(int numberOfSeats) {
	this(); // calls the noArg constructor
	seats = numberOfSeats
}
```

## Copy Constructor Pattern
```
class Car {
    private final Object seats;
    private final Object wheels;

    Car(Car other) {
        this.seats = other.seats;
        this.wheels = other.wheels;
    }
}
```
> **Copy Constructor Pattern** allow to clone an object

# Call by Value vs Call by Reference
Java always **call by value** not by reference.
> If an object is passed, it ***copy the value of its reference***. In other word, ***the reference is copied***. So the "reference copy" ***points to the same instance***
