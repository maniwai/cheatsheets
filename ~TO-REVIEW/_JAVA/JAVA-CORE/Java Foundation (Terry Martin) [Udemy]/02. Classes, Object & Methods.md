# Constructors

### default constructor

Java implicitly create a constructor with no args if no constructor are specify in a class.

> it removes the implicite constructor as soon a constructor is declared.

```
public class Ex {}
```

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
	Ex ex = new Ex();
}
```

# Instance Variable

An instance variable in Java is a variable that belongs to an instance of a class.

> In other words, it's a variable that is associated with an object and not with the class itself. Each object created from a class has its own copy of the instance variables, and changes made to the instance variables of one object do not affect the values of the instance variables in other objects.

# Object Class

Any class not extending other class implicitly extends the class **object**

```
public class App extends Object {}
```

# Package Protected

If no access keyword is specifled for a method, it implicitly implie been **package protected**

```
        void packageProtected() {}
```

... only class in the same package can access this method, not even child class in other package.

# Static Access

### Static Methods

Static methods is commonly used for utility class to hold simple functions

> it solve Java OOP restriction

### Static Variables

Static variables are shared between objects of the class

> it means if an object change the value of the static variables, all other objects will see that change

### Static Initializers

```
static class Ex {
	public static int[] nums;
	static {
		nums = new int[2];
		nums[0] = 1;
		nums[1] = 2;
	}
}
```

... equivalent to:

```
static class Ex {
	public static int[] nums = initNums();

	public static int[] initNums() {
		int[] nums = new int[2];
		nums[0] = 1;
		nums[1] = 2;

		return nums;
	}
}
```

# varArgs

varArgs is a syntaxis sugar to specify an array as argument

```
public static void varArgs(String... words) {}
```

...so we can call simply like this:

```
Ex.varArgs("one", "two", "three");
```

instead of the standard way:

```
public static void noVarArgs(String[] words) {}
```

.., then calling like:

```
String[] words = new String[]{"one", "two", "three"};
Ex.noVarArgs(words);
```
