# S - Single Responsibility Principle

A class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have only one responsibility.

# O - Open/Close Principle

Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- **Open for Extension**: The design should allow new features or behaviors to be added easily without altering the existing code. This is typically achieved through the use of **interfaces, abstract classes, and polymorphism**.
- **Closed for Modification**: Once a module (class, function, etc.) is implemented and tested, its source code should not be modified to add new functionality.
- **Use of Abstraction**: Abstraction plays a crucial role in adhering to the Open/Closed Principle. By defining abstract classes or interfaces, you can create a framework that can be extended without modifying existing code.

In this exemple, the `Shape` interface is introduced, and the `Rectangle` class implements this interface. The `AreaCalculator` class now takes a `Shape` parameter, making it open for extension. If a new shape (e.g., Circle) needs to be added, a new class can be created without modifying the existing code.
```
// Class violating OCP
class Rectangle {
    public double width;
    public double height;
}

class AreaCalculator {
    public double calculateRectangleArea(Rectangle rectangle) {
        return rectangle.width * rectangle.height;
    }
}
```
```
// Improved design following OCP
interface Shape {
    double calculateArea();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private double width;
    private double height;

    // Constructor, getters, setters...

    @Override
    public double calculateArea() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

class AreaCalculator {
    public double calculateArea(Shape shape) {
        return shape.calculateArea();
    }
}
```
> Key point is to accept interface in the parameters instead of concrete class 
# L - Liskov Substitution Principle
Objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
- **Method Signatures**: Subclasses should provide a method that has the same signature as the method in the superclass. This means that the subclass should have the same method name, return type, and parameters.
- **Behavior Consistency**: The behavior of the subclass should be consistent with that of the superclass. This implies that the subclass should not override or change the behavior of the methods in the superclass in a way that violates the expected behavior.
- **Exception Handling**: If the superclass method declares exceptions, the subclass method should not declare more restrictive exceptions. It should either declare the same exceptions or a subset of them.
## Exemple
In this example Sparrow can not fly, if we run this code, it wil throw an exception.

```
Bird[] birds = new Bird[] { new Crow(), new Sparrow(), new Ostrich() };
for (Bird bird : birds) {
	bird.fly();
}
```
To insure all subclass share same method, we need to introduce a new interface FlyingBird:
```
FlyingBird[] flyingBirds = new FlyingBird[] { new Crow(), new Sparrow() };
for (FlyingBird bird : flyingBirds) {
	bird.fly();
}
```
# I - Interface Segragation Principle
A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.
```
// Interface for devices that can print
interface Printer {
    void print();
}

// Interface for devices that can scan
interface Scanner {
    void scan();
}

// Interface for devices that can fax
interface FaxMachine {
    void fax();
}
```
# D - Dependency Inversion Principle
The Dependency Inversion Principle has two key aspects:
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

High-level modules (main business logic) and low-level modules (implementation details) should both depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes).

## breakdown 
- **Abstractions**: Interfaces or abstract classes that define the contract or set of methods that high-level modules will depend on.
- **High-level modules**: Classes or components that contain the application-specific logic. They depend on abstractions, allowing them to remain independent of specific implementation details.
- **Low-level modules**: Classes or components that deal with specific details or implementations. They also depend on abstractions, ensuring that changes in details do not affect high-level modules.

## Example
- The RemoteControl class is a high-level module that *depends* on the Device abstraction (it includes a member variable of type Device).
- The Television class is a low-level module that ***implements*** the Device abstraction. 

The Dependency Inversion Principle is followed because changes in the implementation details of the Television class (such as how it turns on or off) do not affect the RemoteControl class.
```
// Abstraction (interface) representing a device
interface Device {
    void turnOn();
    void turnOff();
}

// High-level module depending on the abstraction
class RemoteControl {
    private Device device;

    RemoteControl(Device device) {
        this.device = device;
    }

    void turnOnDevice() {
        device.turnOn();
    }

    void turnOffDevice() {
        device.turnOff();
    }
}

// Low-level module implementing the abstraction
class Television implements Device {
    @Override
    public void turnOn() {
        System.out.println("Television is turned on");
    }

    @Override
    public void turnOff() {
        System.out.println("Television is turned off");
    }
}
```
