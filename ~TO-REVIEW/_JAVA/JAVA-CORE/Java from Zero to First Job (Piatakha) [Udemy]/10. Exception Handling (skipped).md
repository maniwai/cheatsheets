# Checked and Unchecked Exceptions
Exceptions are categorized into two main types: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions.
- **Checked exceptions** are exceptions that are checked at compile-time. 
	- `IOException`
	- `SQLException`
- **Unchecked exceptions**, also known as runtime exceptions, are exceptions that are not checked at compile-time, because those can only be identified at runtime
	- `RuntimeException`
# Try-Catch-Finally Block

```
try {
	Files.readAllLines(Paths.get("my-file.txt"));
} catch (IOException e) {
	e.getCause(); // get original exception (if any)
	e.getMessage(); // get message (if any)
	e.printStackTrace();
} finally {
	System.out.println("this will always be executed");
}
```
> We can append catch block for each exception type

> We have to catch specific exception (subclass) before generic exception (parent class) or we get a compilation error.
