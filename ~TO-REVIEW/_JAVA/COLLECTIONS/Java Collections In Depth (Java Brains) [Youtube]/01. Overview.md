# Most Used Collections

-   `Collection`:
    -   `List`: **_sequencial_** data structure (similar to array)
    -   `Set`: used to group **_unique_** elements
-   `Map`: **_key-value_** pair.

# Collections Is a Framework

Collections is not a library but a **_framework_** with guideline on how to use it

## Benefits:

-   Already wrote for you
-   High-performance implementations
-   Improves code reusability and maintainability
-   Offers good "preset" data structures

# Data Structures

-   Not all collections are the same
-   Different needs for storage and retrieval

# What Collections Has

-   Core interfaces (`List`, `Set`, `Map`)
-   Specific implementation (eg: `ArrayList`)
-   Abstract implementation (eg: `AbstractList`)
    > to build our own implementation
-   Concurrent implementations (eg: `ConcurrentHashMap`)
    > alternative with **_thread safety_**
-   Algorithms to choose (eg: `sort`, `binarySearch`)
-   Utilities (eg: `Arrays.compare`)

# Choosing The Right Collections

-   Generalization:
    -   Flexibility vs Power (by making use of Polymorphism)
-   Types Of Collections:
    -   Index based retrieval collections
    -   Immutable collections
    -   Order based retrieval collections
-   What methods should it have:
    -   Adding by index
    -   Fetching next element
    -   Finding duplicate elements
    -   Removing an element
    -   Sorting

## Recommanded approach

Choose most Generic and go more specific. In other word, start witn `new Collection`

# The Collection Interface

To implements all those different needs (and make it as much generic), the Collection Framework solved by designing with:

-   **Optional Methods**: If unsupported the collection override by throwing an insupported exception
-   **Iterator pattern**: every collection follow the Iterator pattern as mechanism to get elements.

## Common Methods

-   `size()`: how manny element
-   `isEmtpy()`: true if no elements
-   `contains()`: true if element exist
-   `toArray()`: return an array containing all elements

## Optional Methods

-   `add()` is an exemple of optional methods, each data structure use there own algorithm or throw an insupported exception (ig: immutable)
