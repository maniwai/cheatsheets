# Iterator Interface
Iterator pattern gives a way to traverse a collection of objects without exposing its underlying representation (Collection, List, Set)
> Every Collection implement the iterator interface
```
FruitSupplier fruitSupplier = new FruitSupplier();
Collection<String> fruits = fruitSupplier.getFruits();
// we can use for each becauso Collection implement Iterator
for (String fruit : fruits) {
	System.out.println(fruit);
}
```
## Fail Fast Iterators 
The fail-fast mechanism is employed by some of the collection classes to quickly detect and throw a `ConcurrentModificationException` if the collection is modified while it's being iterated. 

# Collection Intefaces
- `Collection`: `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Deque`
- `Map`
