# Time Complexity
Time complexity describes how the runtime of an algorithm scales with the size of the input. It depends on:
- size of the input
- algorithm used

## Common time complexity
- **O(1)**: Constant time complexity
	>  Fixed runtime regardless of the input size
- **O(n)**: Linear time complexity
	> Scales linearly with the size of the input
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time complexity
	> Proportional to the square of the input size
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time complexity
	> Reduce the problem size in each step (divide-and-conquer)

# Space Complexity
How mutch space in memory it needs to solve the problem

## Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming is a technique that optimally solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem once, and storing solutions to avoid redundant computations.
