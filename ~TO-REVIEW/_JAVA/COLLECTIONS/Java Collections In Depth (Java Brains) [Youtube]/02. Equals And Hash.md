# Check Equality

Most of the time, we want to check equality on value, not on reference

> Java is not able to define rules for each object equality. We only can define the rules.

# Equality With Collection

`equals()` must be implemented when dealing with collections. Because ***collections use heavly equality***. Eg:

- `Set` check duplicate elements
- `contains()` check equality

> `equals` implementation should be based on ***state*** that matters

# The Equals Contract

- **Reflexivity**: An object should be equal to itself
    
    ```java
    p1.equals(p1) // this should always be true
    ```
    
- **Symmetry**: if x is equal to y, y should be equal to x
    
    ```java
    p1.equals(p2)
    p2.equals(p1) // this should always be true
    ```
    
- **Transitivity**: if x equal to y and y equal to z, then x should also be equal to z
    
    ```java
    p1.equals(p2)
    p2.equals(p3) 
    p1.equals(p3) // this should always be true
    ```
    
- **Consistency**: should return the same result unless the state of an object has been modified
    
    ```java
    Point p1 = new Point(1, 2);
    Point p2 = new Point(1, 2);
    System.out.println(p1.equals(p2)); // true
    p1.x = 3;
    System.out.println(p1.equals(p2)); // false
    p1.x = 1;
    System.out.println(p1.equals(p2)); // true
    ```
    
- **Non-nullity**: an object should never be considered equal to null
    
    ```java
    p1.equals(null) // false
    ```
    
    > if it was null, we would get a `NullPointerExeption`
    

# Equals Implementation Walkthrough

The equals method should check for both reference equality and equality based on fields

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
	// 1. Check for Reference Equality
	if (this == o) return true;
	// 2. Check for Null and Class Equality
	if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
	// 3. Type Casting
	Person person = (Person) o; // now, we can safely cast
	// 4. Field Comparison
	// we are using equals method (instead 0f ==) so it also check null
	return age == person.age && Objects.equals(name, person.name);
}
```
# Hashing
Process of ***mapping data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values or keys***, known as **hash codes** or **hash values**, that represent the original data ***in a way that can be easily and quickly lookedup***.

## Hashing use cases
- Password storage
- File integrity checking
- Digital signatures
- Caching

# Equality and Hash Code
***When two objects are equal*** accoring to the `equals()` method, ***they should also have the same hash code***.

# Hashcode Options
- Default: generates a hash code based on the memory address
- We can use a unique member variable
- Generate a hash based on a combination that's unique

# Generatig hashcode
- For single object: `Objects.hashCode`
- `Objects.hashCode(x, y)`
```java
@Override
public int hashCode() {
	return Objects.hash(name, age);
}
```
> `hashCode` ***fields*** must match `equals` ***fields***
