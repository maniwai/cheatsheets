# Set

Contains no pair of elements e1 and e2 such that `e1.equals(e2)`

- no duplicates allowed
- automatically dedupes (don't add if duplicate)
- Only methods are from Collection
- stronger contract for `equals`
- Set can contain only one `null`

## Declaration

```java
Collection<Person> people = new HashSet<>();
```

> Declaring with the type `Set<>` unstead of `Collection<>` don't add any use

## Remove Duplicates

```java
Collection<Type> noDups = new HashSet<Type>(aCollection);
```

> `HashSet` is commonly used to remove duplicates from a `Collection` type

## General Purpose Implementations

`HashSet`, `TreeSet`, `LinkedHashSet`

# HashSet

stores elements in a hash table

- best performing Set
- no guarantee of order

> - it leverage the hashcode of the object to store in a bucket.
> - it uses `HashMap` internaly to store the bucket as a key

> When adding an element, It still needs to compare each elements in the bucket to check for duplicates

## HashSet Time Complexity

- O(1): `add`, `remove`, `contains`

> it needs a good Hash method to perform

## Hash Load Factor

The load factor is a measure of how full a hash table is.  
*Load Factor = Number of Elements / Size*

> When the hash load is too high, it **double the capacity**

### Default Load Factor

- the default load factor is **0.75**
- the initial number of buckets is **16**

> When it reach 12 elements, it **rehash**  
> 12 / 16 = 0.75

> There is **no guarantee of order** because the HashSet might rehash

### Load Factor threshold

- Too small has hash collisions
- Too large slows down iteration

> Most of the time the default works fine (0.75)

# LinkedHashSet

`LinkedHashSet` provides insertion order  
It uses both **hash set** and **linked list** algorithm

> `LinkedHashSet` is a better implementation than `HashSet` givin the ability for ordering without performance penality and ***load factor*** does not affect iteration

# SortedSet

SortedSet is an interface offering:

- natural ordering of element
- Comparator can be supplied

## TreeSet

The `TreeSet` is an implementation of the `SortedSet` using the binary tree algorithm

> Binary tree often gives an unbalanced tree. It Balanced automatly with performance cost of O(log n)

## TreeSet Time Complexity

- **O(log n)**: `add`, `contains`

## NavigableSet
The `NavigableSet` has Navigation method and is also an implementation of the `SortedSet` 
- `lower`, `floor`, `ceiling`, `higher`
