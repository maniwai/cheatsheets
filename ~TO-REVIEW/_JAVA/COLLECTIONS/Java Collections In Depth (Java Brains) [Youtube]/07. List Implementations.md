# ArrayList
```java
List<String> fruits1 = new ArrayList<>();
fruits1.add("apple");
```
> - `List` is an interface
> - `ArrayList` is an implementation of the List interface
> > We choosed the type `List` instead of `ArrayList` because we want to follow the convention of using the most generic type.

## Alternative Way
```java
List<String> fruits2 = Arrays.asList("apple", "banana", "orange");
```
Or better alternative:
```java
List<String> fruits3 = List.of("apple", "banana", "orange");
```
> This is consider better way because it's an ***immutable*** list

## Copying List
```
// copying elements to another list
List<String> fruits2 = new ArrayList<>(fruits);
```

## ArrayList Time Complexity
- Most operations (eg: add, get,set) is o(1)
- O(n) when the array needs to be resized

> Each element in an array is a reference to the objects in the heap

# Vector
The `Vector` use to be the thread safe version of an `ArrayList`
- similar to ArrayList
- but it is synchronized (so thread-safe)
- uncommon usage
> synchronization is slow

# CopyOnWriteArrayList
Use it only when you need ***concurrency*** (***thread safety***)
- thread-safe variant of `ArrayList`
- it's a concurrent collection class
- use a ***copy-on-write*** strategy: it copy for each modification
- ensures that multiple threads can read the list simultaneously without the need for locks
- while still allowing for safe modification
> - CopyOnWriteArrayList is well-suited when many threads will be reading the list, but relatively few will be modifying it
> - less efficient that a standard ArrayList when modifications are frequent

# LinkedList
- `LinkedList` is a doubly-linked list data structure
- each element in the list is ***connected to the next and previous elements***
- ***not recommende***d for use in most situations
```
List<String> fruits = List.of("apple", "banana", "orange");
List<String> fruits2 = new LinkedList<>(fruits);
```
> The only difference in code with an `ArrayList` is instanciating a `new LinkedList<>()` instead of `new ArrayList<>()`
> 
## LinkedList time complexity
Most operations (eg: `add`, `get`, `set`) is **O(n)**
- `add()`: **O(1)** (Append at the end)
- **O(n)**: `add(index, ele)`, `get()`, `remove()`, `contains()`

# Memory usage
- `ArrayList` and `Vector`
	- are backed by an array
	- fixed size + doubling on exceeding size
- `LinkedList`
	- uses more memory that `ArrayList` and `Vector`
