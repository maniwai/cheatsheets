# Arrays and Collections

To understand **collections**, we need to understand:

-   **Primitive Array**: Core Java type
-   **Collection API**: Lists, Sets, Queues, Maps
-   **Generics and Typing**: Autoboxing, Typing, Interfaces

# What is a Collection?

-   **Group of items** that have a relation to each other
-   Items **need to be indexed** by number, position or key to be retrieve
    -   Lists _by index_
    -   Sets _by uniqueness_
    -   Queues _by add/position_
    -   Maps _by key_

# Lists Sets Queues and Maps

-   Lists
    -   Position based by number, starting at 0
    -   Allows for duplicates
    -   Performance slows as list size grows
-   Sets
    -   Position based by number, starting at 0
    -   **Items are unique**, no duplicates
    -   Performance slows as set size grows
-   Queues
    -   Position based by entry into the queue
    -   Allows for duplicates
    -   Performance slows as set size grows
-   Maps
    -   Key based
    -   Keys are unique, no duplicates
    -   Performance doesn't change as map size grows

# Collections API Overview

-   **Collection**
    -   List: `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`
    -   Set: `HashSet`, `TreeSet`
    -   Queue: `PriorityQueue`
-   **Map**: `HashMap`, `TreeMap`
