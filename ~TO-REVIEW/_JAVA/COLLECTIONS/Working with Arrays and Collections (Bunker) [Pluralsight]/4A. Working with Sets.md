# `Set` vs `List` interface

-   **Ordering**:
    -   `List`: the order of elements is based on the sequence in which they are added.
    -   `Set` do not guarantee any specific order of elements.
-   **Duplicates**:
    -   `List` allow duplicate elements. `Set` do not.
    -   `hashCode()` guaranty the uniqueness of our Set

# `HashSet` vs `TreeSet` implementation

**Ordering is the key difference** between HashSet and TreeSet:

-   `HashSet`: Does **not maintain any order** of elements. The elements are **stored in the hash table based on their hash codes**, and the order in which they are stored may not be the same as the order in which they were added.
-   `TreeSet`: **Maintains elements in sorted order**. The elements are **stored in a red-black tree structure**, which allows for quick retrieval and efficient iteration in sorted order.
    > `TreeSet` **order automaticly** as we are adding elements

# The HashSet `hashCode` Method

`HashSet` is like a `List` but it's indexed by his `hashCode` instead of an index (like a `List`). Witch provides **efficient performance** for add, remove, and lookup operations

> The `HashSet` **can not be sorted**, even with the Collection.sort() helper

# The TreeSet `compareTo` Method

`TreeSet` use `compareTo` method instead of the `hashCode` as key, **because it needs to sort** each value as it's added
