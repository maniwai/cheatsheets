# Upper Bound Willdcards: `<? extends T>`

- It specifies that the wildcard type represents an unknown **subtype** of `T` or `T` itself.
- Allows you to retrieve elements from the structure but restricts you from adding elements to it.
- Commonly used when you want to work with a collection of objects of a certain type or any of its subtypes.

```java
public void processElements(List<? extends Number> numbers) {
    for (Number number : numbers) {
        // You can retrieve elements
        System.out.println(number);
    }
    // But you cannot add elements
    // numbers.add(new Integer(42)); // This would be a compilation error
}
```

# Lower Bounded Wildcard: `<? super T>`

- It specifies that the wildcard type represents an unknown **supertype** of `T` or `T` itself.
- Allows you to add elements to the structure but restricts you from retrieving elements in a type-safe manner (you get Object).
- Commonly used when you want to add elements to a collection that is not specific about the exact type but has a common ancestor.

```java
public void addElement(List<? super Number> numbers, Number num) {
    // You can add elements
    numbers.add(num);
    // But you cannot safely retrieve elements
    // Number number = numbers.get(0); // This would require casting
    Object obj = numbers.get(0); // Retrieves as Object, you need to cast
}
```

# In Summary:

- Upper Bound: `<? extends T>`
  - We can read from it, we cannot write to it
- Lower Bound: `<? super T>`
  - We can write to it, but we cannot read
