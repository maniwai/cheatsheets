# Why Generics

## Without Generics

Without Generics, we would need to cast the type in situation (ie: for array) where the compiler is not able to deducte the type.

```java
ArrayList names = new ArrayList();
names.add("Name 1");
names.add("Name 2");

String firstName = (String) names.get(0);
System.out.println(firstName); // Name 1
```

> Here the compiler don't know what's the type we added to the array, so we need to cast to `String`

Casting is not safe, because `add()` takes any `Object` type, so we could add a `Date` object: `names.add(new Date());` and will get an *exception* when casting to a string.

## With Generics

Now with generics, the compiler insure all items in the array are of type strings.

```java
ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
```

... and we don't need to cast anymore:

```java
String firstName = names.get(0);
```

# Autoboxing with Generics

Generics takes only `Object` types **not primitives**.  
To deal with primitives, Java introduced **autoboxing** witch infer the primitive type to its corresponding class wrapper.

```
List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(10, 20, 30);
```

> This code is possible because of **autoboxing**, it infer the type `int` to `Integer`

# Parameterized Types

We can use parameterized types as a placeholder by giving a letter: `<T>`
