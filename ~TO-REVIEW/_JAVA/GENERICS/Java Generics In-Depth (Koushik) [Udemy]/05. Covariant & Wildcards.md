# Generics Are Not Covariant

Generics are not covariant like Object, which means that even if type `S` is a subtype of type `T`, the generic type Generic`<S>` is not a subtype of Generic`<T>`.  
In this Example, even Object is the subclass of all classes, it won't compile:

```java
List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
names.add("Name 1");
names.add("Name 2");
printList(names); // Compile time error: incompatible types 
```

```java
private static void printList(List<Object> names) {
    names.forEach(System.out::println);
}
```

# Wildcards
Instead, we can use wildcards by replacing `<Object>` to `<?>` and it will compile, but it will only allow to read from it, so this code won't work:

```java
private static void printList(List<?> names) {
    names.forEach(System.out::println);
    names.add("hello"); // compilation error: cannot be converted to capture#1 of ?
}
```
