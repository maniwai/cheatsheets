## Template Driven vs Reactive Form

- #### Template Driven Form
  - ##### Advantage:
    - Less coding is required in the component class
    - Easy to understand and start with
  - ##### Disadvantage:
    - Difficult to add controls dynamically at runtime
    - Unit testing is challenging
- #### Reactive Form
  - ##### Advantage:
    - Structure of the form is defined in Typescript class
    - Creating dynamic controls is easier.
    - Easy to unit test
  - ##### Disadvantage:
    - Most of the things are done by writing code

## Using Template Form

- `ngSubmit` is an event binding, it triggers on form submition
  > We must use `<input type="submit" />` to submit the form
- We assign `ngForm` to `#registrationForm` to access the form in the component

> To work with template forms, we must import `FormsModule` in our App Module

```html
<form class="form" (ngSubmit)="OnFormSubmitted()" #registrationForm="ngForm">
  <!-- inputs goes here -->
</form>
```

```ts
export class AppComponent {
  @ViewChild("registrationForm") form?: NgForm;

  OnFormSubmitted() {
    console.log(this.form);
  }
}
```
