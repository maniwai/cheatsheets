## Component Initialization

- **The constructor** is the first method that gets called when a component is instantiated
- Angular does **not** consider the component **fully initialized** at this point.
- The initialization of a component involves several **lifecycle hooks**:

1. #### `constructor`:

   Called **when** the component is **instantiated**,
   **before** Angular has **initialized** the component.

1. #### `ngOnChanges`:

   Called **only once**, **when** the component's **input properties change**.

1. #### `ngOnInit`:

   Called **after** the `constructor` and `ngOnChanges`,
   Angular has **initialized** the component

   > Good for **one-time initialization** tasks.

1. #### `ngDoCheck`:

   Called during **every change detection** cycle

   > Useful for custom change detection and manual checking of component properties.

1. #### `ngAfterContentInit`:

   Called **only once**, **after** the **projected content** has been fully **initialized**

   > This hook is available for component

1. #### `ngAfterContentChecked`:

   Called **after** every **check** of the **projected content**.

1. #### `ngAfterViewInit`:

   Called **after** the component's **view** has been **initialized**.

1. #### `ngAfterViewChecked`:

   Called **after** every **check** of the component's **view**.

1. #### `ngOnDestroy`:

   Called just **before** Angular **destroys** the component

   > Useful for **cleanup** tasks like unsubscribing from observables.

#### Change Detection Cycle

- **The change detection cycle** is used by Angular to **keep** the view template **in sync** with the component class.
- It **checks for changes** in the application state and propagates those changes to **update the view**.

## `ngOnChanges`

- Get **executed** also when a new component is **created**
- **Also** get **executed everytime** the input bound **properties changes**

```ts
  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
    console.log(changes);
  }
```

> `SimpleChanges` contains information about **previous and current values** of the changed properties

## `ngOnInit`

- Get executed **only once** after a new component is created and after `ngOnChanges`
- **None** of the child components, or projected contents, or view, **are available** at this point
  - Property decorated with `@ViewChild`, `@ViewChildren`, `@ContentChild`, or `@ContentChildren`, are **not available**

```ts
  ngOnInit() {
    console.log(this.tempPara.nativeElement.innerHTML); // Error: undefined
  }
```

> **Error**: trying to access a native element before it has been initialized

## `ngOnInit`

Called during **every change detection** cycle

> Useful for custom change detection and manual checking of component properties.

## `ngAfterContentInit`

- Get executed **only once** after a new component is created after `ngOnInit`
- All the **projected contents** have been fully **initialized** at this point
  - `@ContentChild` and `@ContentChildren` are **available**

```html
<!-- parent.component.html -->
<app-demo [message]="inputVal">
  <p #temp>This is projected content</p>
</app-demo>
```

```ts
// child.component.ts
export class DemoComponent implements AfterContentInit {
  @ContentChild("temp") paraContent: ElementRef;

  ngAfterContentInit() {
    console.log(this.paraContent.nativeElement);
    // <p>This is projected content</p>
  }
}
```

## `ngAfterContentChecked`

- Similar to `ngAfterContentInit` but get executed **at every change detection**

## `ngAfterViewInit`

- Get executed **only once** after a new component is created after `ngAfterContentChecked`
- All the **View template** have been fully **initialized** at this point
  - `@ViewChild` and `@ViewChildren` are **available**

## `ngAfterViewChecked`

- Similar to `ngAfterViewChecked` but get executed **at every change detection**

## `ngOnDestroy`

Called just **before** Angular **destroys** the component

> Useful for **cleanup** tasks like unsubscribing from observables.
