# Abstract Factory Pattern

The abstract factory is most of the time choosen over the factory method for the additionnal benefice it offers

-   Heavy abstraction
-   used for framework pattern

## Concepts

-   Factory of Factories (Factory Method Pattern)
-   Factory of related objects
-   Common interface
-   Defer instanciation logic to subclasses

## Identifying

```typescript
const abstractFactory = CreditCardFactory.getCreditCardFactory(775);
const card = abstractFactory.getCreditCard(CARD_TYPE.PLATINIUM);
```

## Java API Example

-   `DocumentBuilder`
-   Mostly implemented in Frameworks

## Design

```mermaid
classDiagram
AbstractFactory <-- ConcreteFactory
ConcreteFactory <-- ConcreteProduct
class AbstractFactory
<<interface>> AbstractFactory
AbstractFactory: +createProduct() Object
class ConcreteFactory {
    +concreteProduct() Object
}
class ConcreteProduct
```

-   Groups Factories together
-   Factory is responsible for lifecycle
-   Common Interface (`AbstractFactory`)
-   Concrete Classes returned
-   Parameterized create method
-   Typicaly build using **Composition**

## Everyday Example - `DocumentBuilderFactory`

```java
DocumentBuilderFactory abstractFactory = DocumentBuilderFactory.newInstance();
DocumentBuilder factory = abstractFactory.newDocumentBuilder();
Document doc = factory.parse(bais)
```

> -   `DocumentBuilderFactory` is an **abstract factory**
> -   `DocumentBuilder` is a factory
> -   `Document` is the concrete class returned

## Pitfalls

-   Complexity: most difficult creational pattern to implement
-   Pattern within a pattern
-   Starts as Factory, refactored as Abstract Factory

## Abstract Factory vs Factory Pattern

Abstract Factory adds more benefice to the Factory:

-   Implemented with a Factory
-   Hides the Factory
-   Abstracts Environment
-   Typicaly built through Composition
