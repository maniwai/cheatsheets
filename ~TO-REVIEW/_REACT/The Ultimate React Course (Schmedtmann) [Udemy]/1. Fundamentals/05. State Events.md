## Section Overview

- Handling **events**
- **State** to update the UI

## `onClick()` Event Listener

```jsx
<button onClick={() => alert("previous")}>Previous</button>
```

> Note: It must be in a callback function otherwise **it would be directly executed**

## What is State?

- State is data that a component can **hold over time**
- We can think of it as **component's memory**
- Updating component state triggers React to **re-render the component**
  > State allows us to:
  >
  > 1. Update the component's view (by re-rendering it)
  > 2. Persist local variables between renders

#### `useState()`

- `useState()` takes the **intial value**
- and **return an array** with
  - the **current value**
  - and the **callback function**
    > **State** must be set **via the callback**, not manually
    > That's why we are using `const` keyword

```javascript
const [step, setStep] = useState(1);

function handlePrevious() {
  if (step > 1) setStep(step - 1);
}
function handleNext() {
  if (step < 3) setStep(step + 1);
}
```

> all functions starting with use are called **hooks** in React

> Hooks must be defined **at the top** of the component

#### Re-Rendering

- React **reacts** to state changes by re-rendering the view to synchronize the UI with the data
- So to updated a view, we update state

- Event handler -> Update State -> Re-Render

> State is preserved through re-renders

#### Switch Pattern

```jsx
<button className="close" onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)}>
```

> `!isSomeState` is a common pattern to

#### Update State

The proper way to update state, **_if based on the current state_**, is with as **callback function**

```jsx
if (step < 3) {
  setStep(step + 1);
  setStep(step + 1); // Won't work, it will be ignored
}
```

Correct way:

```jsx
if (step < 3) {
  setStep((s) => s + 1);
  setStep((s) => s + 1);
}
```

Same goes for expression litteral:

```jsx
onClick={() => setIsOpen((is) => !is)}
```

> If the value **don't depends** on the current state, we don't need to use a callback

```jsx
setSomeState({name: "Foo"});
```

#### Declarative Paradigm

- With state, we view UI as a **reflection of data changing over time**
- We **describe that reflection** of data using state, event handlers, and JSX

#### Practical Guidelines About State

- **Use a state variable** for any data that the component should :
  - **keep track** of ("remember") over time
  - and that **will change** at some point
- If we want to change the UI, **update the state**
  - This usually happens in an **event handler** function
- When building a component, imagine its view as a **reflection of state changing over time**
- For data that should not trigger component re-renders, **don't use state**
  - Use a **regular variable** instead
