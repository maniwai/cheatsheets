### Section Overview

- **Core concepts**: components, props, JSX
- Creating and reusing components
- Rendering **lists**
- **Conditional** rendering

### Rendering the Root Component

```jsx
const App = () => <h1>Hello React!!!</h1>;
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<App />);
```

> `<App />` is a function component defined in `App()`

### React Components

- React applications are **entirely** made out of components
- React renders a **view** for each component
- Each component has its own **data**, **logic** and **appearance**
- Components can be **nested** and we can **pass data** between them

##### Component Trees

- A component tree represents the hierarchical structure of components, forming a parent-child relationship

- It facilitate component composition, data flow, and reusability for building modular and maintainable user interfaces

##### Creating a Component

- A component must return a JSX

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello React!!!</h1>
      <Pizza />
    </div>
  );
}
function Pizza() {
  return <h2>Pizza</h2>;
}
```

> We are nesting `<Pizza />` inside `<App />`

### JSX

- **JSX** is a syntax of Javascript that allows us to embed **Javascript** and **CSS** into **HTML**

- **Babel** is a tool to convert **JSX** to **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Javascript**
  > Each component is converted to a `React.createElement()`

### Imperative vs Declarative

React is a declarative paradigm:

- it describe what we want the UI look like **based on current data** (props and state)
- it abstract the DOM away so we never touch it
  > We think the UI as a **reflection of the current data**

### CSS with React

- In JSX, we need to declare a style using a JS Object `style={{ color: "red" }}`
  > `class` html attribute must be called `className="container"`

### Passing and Receiving Props

To define props:

1. We pass the props with arguments to the child component
2. We can access those variables in the child component with the `props` object

```jsx
function Menu() {
  return (
    <main className="menu">
      <Pizza name="Pizza Funghi" price={12} />
    </main>
  );
}
function Pizza(props) {
  return (
    <div className="pizza">
      <h3>{props.name}</h3>
      <span>{props.price}</span>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> For numbers, we are passing it as an object `{12}` to be able to manipulate them

### Data in React

- Props are **immutable** (read-only)
  - If we need to mutate props, we have to use **state**
- Props data are coming from the **outside**
  - It can only be updated by the **parent** component
- State is **internal** data that can be update by the component's **logic**
- Data are **OneWay Data Flow**, they propagate from parent to child

### Rules Of JSX

- lik HTML, but we can enter JS mode using `{}`
- We can use **JS expressions** inside {}
  - but statements are not allowed (if/else, for, switch)
- We can write JSX anywhere inside a component
- JSX can only have one root element
  - If we need more, we use `<React.Fragment>` (or in short `<>`)

### Rendering List with `Map()`

```jsx
function Menu() {
  return (
    <div>
      {pizzaData.map((pizza) => ( // we are now passing an array directly with map()
        <Pizza pizzaObj={pizza} key={pizza.name} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

function Pizza(props) {
  return (
    <h3>{props.pizzaObj.name}</h3>
    <p>{props.pizzaObj.ingredients}</p>
  );
}
```

> We need to pass a unique key with a list `key={pizza.name}`

### Conditional Rendering

We have **three way** to render JSX based on **condition**:

- Logical Operators
- Ternary Operator
- Multiple Returns
  - Multiple Returns doesnÂ´t allow nested html tags shared between returns

### Destructuring Props

We can use destructuring to directly access the objects

```jsx
function Pizza({pizzaObj}) {
  return <h3>{pizzaObj.name}</h3>;
}
```

### React Fragment

- Fragment allow to group html element with `<>`
- Usefull when we don't want to break a layout

```jsx
  return (
    <>
      <p></p>
      <ul></li>
    </>
  );
```

> `<>` is a shorthand of `<React.Fragment>`

### Conditional Classes

We can use JS expression inside template litteral

```jsx
<li className={`pizza ${pizzaObj.soldOut ? "sold-out" : ""}`}>
```
