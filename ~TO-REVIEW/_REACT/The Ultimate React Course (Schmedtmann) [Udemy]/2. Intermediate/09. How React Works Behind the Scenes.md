## Components vs Instances vs Elements

- #### Component

  - A component is **a function** that **returns React elements**
  - Similar to a **class**, it's the **blueprint to create instances**

    ```jsx
    function Tab() {
      return <h1>Hello</h1>;
    }
    ```

- #### Instance
  - Instances are created when we **use** the component
  - It has his own **state**, **props** and **lifecycle**
  - Similar to an **object**, it's an instance of the component
    ```jsx
    <Tab />
    ```
- #### Element
  - Elements are the **returns of the function**
    - **JSX is converted to DOM elements** implicitly with `React.createElement()`
    ```jsx
    return <h1>Hello</h1>;
    ```

## Update Process

When a state is updated it triggers the **Update Process**:

1. **Render** Phase:
   - React **determines** what changes need to be made to the virtual DOM **based** on the updated **state** and **props**.
     > When a component is updated all its children are rerendered as well
   - Components are **scheduled to be updated**, and React constructs a **virtual representation of the changes** that need to be applied to the DOM
2. **Commit** Phase:
   - React **applies the changes** determined during the render phase to the actual DOM.
   - React **applies the minimal set of changes** necessary to update the DOM efficiently

> **By splitting the update process** into these two phases, **React can optimize the rendering** and minimize the impact on the actual DOM

#### Fiber Tree

- The **Fiber Tree** is a linked list data structure used to represent the components and their relations. **Each Fiber** representing a component and it states
- React **compare the Fiber Tree with the Virtual DOM** to determine the change
  > This operation is called: **Reconciliation / Diffing**

#### The Key Prop

1. The **Key Prop** is used to tell the **diffing** that an **element is unique**
   - Allows React to **distinguish between multiple instances** of the same component type
     > **We need to use keys** for any instances of same components at same position in a tree like "**_a list_**"
2. It's also used **to tell the diffing when to reset a state**

## Two Types of Logic

There is **two types of logic** in react components:

1. #### Render Logic:
   - Code that lives at the **top level** of the component function
   - Participates in **describing** how the component view looks like
   - Code that is executed **every time** the component renders
2. #### Event Handler Functions:
   - Executed as a **consequence of the event** that the handler is listening for
   - Code that actually **does things**: update state, perform HTTP request, read input field, navigate to another page, ...

## Functional Programming Principle

- #### Side Effect
  Side effect is the **interation with the outside** of the function scope
  - **dependency on** any data outside the function scope
  - or **modification to** any data outside the function scope
    > **Side Effects are necessary** in an application but they need to be identify to be controlled

```javascript
// dependency side effect
function dateNow(r) {
  return Date.now(); // unpredictable output
}
// modification side effect
const outside = "";
function Foo() {
  outside = "bar"; // outside variable mutation
}
```

- #### Pure Function
  A pure function is a function that has **no side effects**:
  - Does **not** change any variables outside its scope
  - Given the **same input** always returns the **same output**

## Rules for Render Logic

- **Component must be pure** when it comes to render logic
  - Given the **same props** (input), a component must return the **same JSX** (output)
- Render logic must produce **no side effects**, no interaction with the outside scope:
  - Do NOT perform **network requests** (API calls)
  - Do NOT start **timers**
  - Do NOT directly **use the DOM API**
  - Do NOT **mutate objects or variables** outside the function scope
  - Do NOT **update state (or refs)**: this will create an infinite loop!
    > Side effects are allowed in **event handler functions**, there is also a special hook to **register side effects**: `useEffect()`

## Batched State Updates

- React groups multiple state updates or side-effects into a single update
- Updated state variables are available only after re-render
  > If we need to update state **based on current state**,
  > we must use `setState` **with a callback**

```jsx
function handleLike() {
  setLikes(() => likes + 1);
}
```

## Practical Summary

- When a component instance gets re-rendered, **all its children will get re-rendered as well**
  - This does **not** mean that all child will get updated
  - The "**reconciliation**" checks which elements have actually changed
- "**Diffing**" is how React decides witch DOM elements need to be added or modified.
- "**Key Prop**" allows React to distinguish between multiple component instances
  - When the key change between renders, the DOM element will be destroyed and rebuilt
- The logic that produces JSX output for a component instance ("render logic") is not allowed to product any side effects
- **Side Effects** are not allowed inside "**Render Logic**" (JSX output)
- The DOM is updated by `ReactDOM` in the **commit phase**
- State updates are **batched** to perform only **one** re-render
  - state update are **asynchronous**
  - we can **not access a state variable immediatly after updating it**
- Event handlers are manage by a "**synthetic event object**", not the browser's native object
  - All **synthetic events bubble** except the scroll event
