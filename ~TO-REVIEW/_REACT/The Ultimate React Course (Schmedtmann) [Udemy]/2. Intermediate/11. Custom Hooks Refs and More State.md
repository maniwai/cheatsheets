## Section Overview

- **Rules** of Hooks
- **Deep** dive into useState
- `useRef`
- **Custom** hooks

## What Are React Hooks

- Allow us to "hook" into React internals:

  - Creating and accessing state from Fiber tree
  - Registering side effects in Fiber tree
  - Manual DOM selections
  - Many more ...
  -

- Enable easy reusing of non-visual logic (non-UI logic):
  - we can compose multiple hooks into our own custom hooks

#### Build-In Hooks

- **Most** used: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`, `useContext`
- **Less** used: `useRef`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useTransition`, `useDeferredValue`

#### Rules of Hooks

1. Only call hooks at the **top level**
   - Do **NOT** call hooks inside **conditionals**, **loops**, **nested functions**, of after an **early return**
2. Only call hooks from React functions
   - Only call hooks inside a **function component** or a **custom hook**

> These rules are automatically enforced by **ESLint**

## Defining and Updating State

1. Creating State

   - Simple
     ```javascript
     const [count, setCount] = useState(23);
     ```
   - Based on function (lazy evaluation)

     ```javascript
     const [count, setCount] = useState(() => localStorage.getItem("count"));
     ```

     > Function must be **pure** and accept **no arguments**.

     > Called only on **initial render**

2. Updating State

   - Simple

     ```javascript
     setCount(1000);
     ```

   - Based on current state

     ```javascript
     setCount((c) => c + 1);
     ```

     > Function must be **pure** and return next state

   > We must make sure to **NOT** mutate objects or arrays, but **replace** them

## The `useRef` Hook

- **Refs** are object with a **mutable** `.current` property
  - the data is **persisted across renders** (unlike regular variables)
- **Refs** are like states but for **data that is NOT rendered**
  - used in event handlers or effects, not in JSX (otherwise use state)
  - Do **NOT** read or write `.current` in render logic (like state)
- We use the property **`.current` to read and write value**
  - the **update is synchronous** because the value is mutable

```javascript
const myRef = useRef(0);
```

```javascript
myRef.current = 1;
```

#### Use Cases:

1. Creating a variable that stays the same between renders
2. Selecting and storing DOM elements

#### State vs Refs

We use refs if the data do **NOT** need to re-render components

|                               | State | Refs |
| ----------------------------- | ----- | ---- |
| Persists Across Renders       | ✅    | ✅   |
| **Updating Causes Re-Render** | ✅    | ❌   |
| Immutable                     | ✅    | ❌   |
| Asynchronous Updates          | ✅    | ❌   |

## Custom Hooks

- Allow us to reuse **non-visual logic** across components
- It's considered a hook when **it uses one or more React hooks** inside the function

```javascript
function useFetch(url) {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);
  useEffect(function () {
    // ...
```

> The function name **must start with `use`** to be considered a hook by React
