## Why `useReducer`?

1. When components have a **lot of state variables and state updates**
2. When **multiple state updates** need to happen **at the same time**
3. When updating one piece of state **depends on one or multiple other pieces of state**

## Managing State with `useReducer`

- Stores related pieces of state in a **`state`** object
- **`reducer`** function containing **all logic to update state**
  - `reducer` is a pure function (**no side effect!**)
  - it takes the current state and action, and **returns the next state**
- **`action`** is an object that describe **how to update state**
- **`dispatch`** is a function to trigger state updates
  - it **send actions** from the **event handler** to the **`reducer`**

```javascript
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
```

```javascript
dispatch({type: "setCount", payload: Number(e.target.value)});
```

```javascript
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "inc":
      return state + 1;
    case "setCount":
      return action.payload;
    // ...
```

> `dispatch({type, payload})` -> `reducer(state, action)` -> next state -> re-render

> `action` contains the payload

## `useState` vs `useReducer`

| `useState`                                                                                                            | `useReducer`                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ideal for **single, independent pieces of state** (numbers, strings, single arrays, etc.)                             | Ideal for multiple **related pieces of state** and **complax state** (object with many values and nested objects or arrays) |
| Logic to update state is placed directly in event handlers or effects, **spread all over one or multiple components** | Logic to update state lives in **one central place, decoupled from components**: the reducer                                |
| State is updated by **calling `setState`** (setter returned from useState)                                            | State is updated by **dispatching an action** to a reducer                                                                  |
| **Imperative** state updates: `setScore(0); setPlaying(true);`                                                        | **Declarative** state updates: complex state transitions are **mapped** to actions: `dispatch({type: "startGame"}); `       |
| **Easy** to understand and to use                                                                                     | More **difficult** to understand and implement                                                                              |
