## Arrow Functions

The main difference between a regular function and an arrow function is the context of `this` keywords.

Arrow functions inherit the value of `this` from their surrounding (lexical) scope

```javascript
let RegularFunction = () => {
    this.value = 10;
    this.printArrowValue = () => {
        // this is inherited
        console.log('Arrow Function:', this.value);
    };
};
```

> regular function would have create his own private context and would have return undefined
