## Object Destructuring

Object desctructuring is a shorthand syntax to extract paramenters from an object

```typescript
// without object destructuring
const title = course.title,
    subtitle = course.subtitle,
    lessonsCount = course.lessonsCount;
```

```typescript
// with object destructuring
const { title, subtitle, lessonsCount } = course;
```

We can also use spread operators in conjunction to extrat the rest of the object in a variable (here `other`)

```typescript
const { title, ...other } = course;
console.log(other.subtitle);
```
