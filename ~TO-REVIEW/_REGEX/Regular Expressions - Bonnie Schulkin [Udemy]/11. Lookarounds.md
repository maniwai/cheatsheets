# Lookarounds
Lookarounds specify conditions for regex without capturing:
- positive lookarounds: What you **do** want to see immediately before/after part of regex
- negative lookarounds: What you **don't** want to see immediately before/after part of regex
> Note: Lookarounds are different from non-capturing group in that it is **not** part of match. So they are more like tokens (`^$\b\B`)

> In some plateforms like Java, only support **fixed-width** lookarounds, means **quantifiers are not allow**, because of performance risk. In Javascript, Lookarounds are not supported for some browsers.

### Lookarounds syntax:
- `(?=)` Positive Lookahead
- `(?!)` Negative Lookahead
- `(?<=)` Positive Lookbehind
- `(?<!)` Negative Lookbehind

### Exemple
- `(?<=USD )\d+(?:\.\d\d)?$`
	- `(?<=USD )` Lookbehind: match but don't capture
	- `(?:\.\d\d)?` Optional non-capturing group
		> It will still be part of the match, but not the group alone
- `(?<!^)(?<![\.?!]\s)[A-Z]\w*\b`
	- `(?<!^)` first negative lookbehind: we don't want begining of the line
	- `(?<![\.?!]\s)` second negative lookbehind: we don't want a ponctuation follow by a space
	- `[A-Z]\w*\b` match capitalized word followed by a boundary
