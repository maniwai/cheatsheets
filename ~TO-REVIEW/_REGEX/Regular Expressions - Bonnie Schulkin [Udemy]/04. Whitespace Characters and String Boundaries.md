# Backslash Revisited
- `\` backslash escape a charactere with a meaning (?). 
	It also give a special meaning to charactere without meaning.
	- `\t` tab character
	- `\n` newline
	- `\v` vertical tab

### Exemple
- `\tb` *\[tab\]b*

# Introduction to String Boundaries
> **String boundaries** also called **anchors**:
> - These tokens don't consume characters (like `\b` and *lookarrounds*)
> - They indicate where the regex is positioned within the string

- `^` anchor at start of string
	> `[^abc]` inside brackets, caret has different meaning, it negate the characters
- `$` anchor at end of string

### Exemple:
`^ +.*` match any char with 1 or more space at the beginning
`^[A-Z].+[\.?!]$` must start with A-Z and end with ponctuation
