# Multi-Character & Groups
- `(one|two|three)` `()` define a group where we can specify multi-characters string. 
- `(hey!+)` + at the end but inside the group applies only to the last caracter: *hey!!!*
- `(hey!)+` the quantifier outside the group applies to the group: *hey!hey!hey!*
###  Collections within Groups
- `([ao]h!)` we can combine groups with collections: *ah!*, *oh!*
### Exemple: 24 hours clock
`^(1?\d|2[0-3]):[0-5]\d$` *0:00* to *23:59*
- `1?\d` first multi-character option: one or two digit from 0 to 19
	>1 is optional, followed by any 1 digit char
- or `2[0-3]` *20* to *23*
- `[0-5]\d` two-digit between *00* to *59*
	> first digit between 0 to 5, second digit can be anything
