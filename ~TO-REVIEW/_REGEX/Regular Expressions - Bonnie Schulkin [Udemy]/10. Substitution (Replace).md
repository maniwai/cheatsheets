# Replace with Fixed String
`$1` is a placeholder for replacement by the group number
### Exemple 1
- regex: `a(kitten|puppy)`
- substitution: `the cutest $1`
- string: *I have **a kitten** and **a puppy**.*
- result: *I have **the cutest kitten** and **the cutest puppy**.*
> note: *'a'* is replaced by *'the'* because they are included in the expressions
### Exemple 2
- regex: `[*_]` we want to remove all * and _ from a string
- substitution: (we leave it empty)
- string: *_my string**
- result: *my string*
> note: `*` has no meaning in this context, so we don't need to escape
