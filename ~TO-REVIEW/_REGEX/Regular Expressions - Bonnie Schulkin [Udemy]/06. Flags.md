# Introduction to Flags
- `(?g)` **global**: match as many times as you can (without flag = only once)
	> In Java, there isn't a direct equivalent to the global flag. Instead, you typically use the Matcher class and its find method to find multiple matches in a string.
- `(?m)` **multi-line**: match ^ and $ at the beginning/end of each line (without flag = beginning/end of the string)
- `(?i)` **case-insensitive**: match upper or lower case
- `(?s)` **single line**: treat the string as a single line (`.` now includes newline)

### Exemple
- `(?m)^Hello.*bye!$` with the `(?m)` flag, it match the first line, but not the second
	**Hello. Goodbye!**
	Hello, abc. Goodbye!
- `(?m)(?s)^Hello.*bye!$`  with the `(?s)` flag, it now match both line
	**Hello. Goodbye!
	Hello, abc. Goodbye!**
