# Capturing Groups
### Captures
- `(?:abc)` `?:` at the beginning of the group specifie a non-capturing group
- `\1` we can refer to a group inside the regular expression using backslash followed by the number. `\1` refer to *group 1*
- `(?<myname>)` we can also name a group with a tag
### Exemple
- `(.+)\.(?:png|jpe?g|pdf)` will capture only the first group, not the group with the extensions
- `<(\w+)>.*<\/\1>` will capture the first tag to reuse with `\1`: `<div>hello</div>`
- `(?<rootname>.+)\.(?<extension>png|jpe?g|pdf)`
	we are naming 2 groups: '*rootname*' and '*extension*'
