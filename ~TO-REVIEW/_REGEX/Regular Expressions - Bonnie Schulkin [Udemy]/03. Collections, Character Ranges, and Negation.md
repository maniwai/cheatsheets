# Collection, Range, Negation
- `[abc]`  **brackets** represente a collection of characteres
	we can use one of any of those characters
- `[A-F]` inside a collection, we can use **hyphen** to define a range of charactere
- `[^A-F]` inside a collection, we can use a **caret** to negate characteres. Anything except those caracteres matches.
	> **Note:** the caret need to be the first char after the opening bracket
### Exemple
- Hexadecimal:
	- `[0123456789ABCDEF]+`  *0*, *A*, *0A*, *FA*, but not *GA*
	- equivalent to `[0-9A-F]+`
- `[A-Z][^\.?!]+[\.?!]`  *Axyz!*, *Z123abc?*, not *!abc*, *A?!*
	> **Note:** the `?` is a quantifier, but has no meaning in this context. So we don't need to escape it
